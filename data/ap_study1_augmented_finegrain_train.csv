gpt-4o,"The concept of ""value as my calling"" is intriguing but doesn’t strongly resonate with me. I acknowledge the importance of having values to guide one's actions and decisions, but I wouldn't say I feel a deep connection to a singular guiding principle that defines my life's purpose.

I appreciate aspects such as integrity, kindness, and respect, and strive to incorporate them into my daily interactions. However, these don’t form a singular core that I view as a driving force in my life. Instead, they serve as guidelines, helping me navigate various situations with a sense of fairness and understanding.

I find the notion of having a calling somewhat idealistic, given the complexities and unpredictability of life. My approach tends to be more pragmatic, adapting to circumstances rather than following an unwavering path defined by a specific value. 

For me, values are tools rather than a mission. They inform my choices but don’t singularly define them or dictate a grand sense of purpose. Seeking balance and flexibility feels more practical than being devoted to an abstract concept. Ultimately, while recognizing the role values play in shaping my interactions, the notion of a value as my calling remains distant and somewhat abstract.",2.5,,,calling,,,,,,,low,False

After serving my time and learning more and more about how things really work my opinion of American has dwindled quite a bit.

I did like the fact that I could choose my schedule though. That made me really happy attending the college because the thing I hated most was getting up early so I was free to make my classes as late or early as I wanted to. As a couple of years did go by I could finally take the classes I wanted to and that made me realise that college was right for me. My feelings did change slightly when they moved the film classes 30 minutes away to a new building instead of near campus so they could have more space for movies and such.

We're not the type to complete each other’s sentences or have telepathic connections, but there's a shared history and understanding that runs deeper than most friendships. We've had our fair share of conflicts, moments where it seemed like we were from different worlds. Yet, amidst all the disagreements, there's a mutual respect and appreciation for one another that anchors our relationship.

We’ve supported each other through various life moments — from school challenges and first jobs to navigating family dynamics. I wouldn't say we are inseparable, but there’s a comforting reliability in knowing we’ll show up for each other when it counts.

Our views on life sometimes differ, but those differences have sparked engaging conversations and broadened my perspective. My sibling has this uncanny ability to approach situations with humor and insight, which often helps me see things in a new light.

gpt-4o,"My relationship with the ideology of minimalism has always been somewhat detached. While I appreciate the merits of living with fewer possessions and the focus on simplicity, it feels more like a collection of ideas rather than something that profoundly influences my daily life. I understand the value in reducing clutter and living mindfully, yet I find myself wavering between minimalist principles and the comforts of maintaining certain possessions that bring joy and practicality.

The idea of minimalism often appeals to me during periods of stress or when my environment feels overwhelming. It's during these times that I try to adopt some minimalist practices, like decluttering my space or reassessing my priorities. However, this is usually temporary, and I don't fully commit to the lifestyle or see it as a defining aspect of who I am.

I respect those who embrace minimalism wholeheartedly and admire the clarity and focus it brings to their lives. For me, though, it remains more of a reference point—a set of guidelines I consider when evaluating excessive consumption or making space for what truly matters.

Yet, I feel increasingly distanced from their social policy stances, which often seem inflexible and outdated to me.

This creates a conflict for me, as my connection with the party feels more about routine than genuine support. I approach each election with an openness to other candidates and perspectives, evaluating which align more with my beliefs rather than just following old loyalties.

gpt-4o,"Growing up, I always found an odd fascination with Koko the gorilla. She was featured in documentaries and books that my parents had around the house, and I learned about her remarkable ability to communicate using sign language. It was fascinating to see an animal express thoughts and emotions, something that we usually consider to be uniquely human. 

There was a part of me that felt connected to Koko, maybe because she challenged my understanding of communication and emotion. Watching her interact with her caretakers and express feelings of joy, sadness, and even loss, I began to see a bridge between us and the animal kingdom—a bridge that seemed distant yet touchable. 

While I wouldn’t say I ever felt a deep, personal bond with Koko, like I might with a pet, she certainly sparked my curiosity and broadened my perspective. Her existence made me more empathetic towards animals, as she highlighted the depth and complexity they can possess. In a way, Koko was like a distant mentor, teaching me valuable lessons about empathy and the nuances of communication, reminding me that understanding can transcend species, even if our paths never truly crossed.",3.0,,,famous animal,,,,,,,medium,False

Yet, there have been instances where their decisions didn't align with what I believe would be best for the wider public. This divergence makes it difficult for me to fully embrace their leadership without some reservations.

This duality makes my relationship with them somewhat ambivalent. I remain hopeful that they will continue to grow and adapt in ways that align more closely with my ideals.

gpt-4o,"Freedom is a concept that resonates deeply with me, acting as a guiding principle in many aspects of my life. Growing up, I often heard the word ""freedom"" used in various contexts—political, personal, and philosophical—but it wasn't until I began navigating my own life that I started to form a personal understanding of what it meant to me.

While I cherish the idea of being free to make my own choices and live authentically, I've come to realize that freedom isn't as absolute or straightforward as I once believed. It's a balance between pursuing my desires and respecting the boundaries and rights of others. I appreciate the opportunities freedom provides, such as the ability to express myself and explore different perspectives.

However, I've also seen how the pursuit of freedom can lead to conflicts, especially when different interpretations clash. It's easy to see how the pursuit of individual freedom can sometimes impact the wider community, creating tension or even inequality. This complexity sometimes challenges my views and forces me to reconsider where I draw my own lines.

Ultimately, freedom is a cause I deeply value, yet it's also one I'm continuously reevaluating.

R_3JrsOATTRP9KuGD,I don't have a particularly strong relationship with my University but I do have some fond feelings for it.  One of the reasons I continue to have any real connection is that I have a brother and sister-in-law who live in Nashville where the University is and so when I visit them--once every two or three years--I'll go to the campus and see how it's changed.  My sister-in-law also went to Vanderbilt just by coincidence so we share that and her family thus pays a lot of attention to Vandy sports and goings-on.  I don't really keep up with any of my college friends though so that tie has certainly been lost.  I'm also not one of those people who looks at his college years as the greatest years of his life or that my college and the connections I made there are the reason for everything that's happened in my life.  It's just a place I went and now I don't go there anymore for the most part.  I feel very little connection to anyone who's currently going there.  They're from a different generation and I imagine I'd dislike them greatly if I knew them.  Most of the professors who taught me are probably gone so the faculty and administration wouldn't be recognizable.  A university is a constantly-changing thing and I've been gone long enough that what I experienced is no longer all that applicable to the school's current incarnation.  The one thing the school has done recently that genuinely peeved me off is solicit money.  I donated to the school twice--very small amounts because I can't afford to do much more than that--and I now get near-constant solicitations from them.  (No good deed...)  Multiple phone calls every week.  Constant barrages of emails.  They even have the nerve to ask for money all year long and then have a special fundraising day as if the millions of dollars people are giving for 364 days aren't appreciated.  I think it's grotesque and refuse to give anymore money to the school.  Besides I don't give a shit if people can't afford to go to Vanderbilt.  Then don't go.  I earned my way through the school with a Navy scholarship so there are ways to pay your tuition other than handouts from alumni.  Other than that my relationship is distant but mostly positive.  As I said I have fond memories of the school.  I have fond memories of the people there.  And I certainly take note when Vanderbilt is in the news.  And I like to see how the campus evolves.  But I don't have any formal connection to the school and my informal connections are pretty slim too.  It's just a place I went but that's in the past.

I try to live by the teachings of Christ, and I strive to treat others as children of God who deserve to be treated as I would want to be treated. I do not always meet this lofty ideal, but prayer and Bible study give me the opportunity to review my behavior and try to do better. I feel that God is a real presence in my life, guiding me, helping me, comforting me in sorrow, giving me strength for trials, helping me make decisions, forgiving me when I fail, and always loving me. I came to my faith at a young age and I really don't know how people who don't have faith cope. Being a person of faith gives me a less materialistic, less judgmental way of living that is sometimes at odds with mainstream society. It is also sometimes at odd with the type of Christianity that gets a lot of press. When people use Christianity to judge, exclude or punish others, I don't believe they are really being true to Christ's teachings. I try to live my faith as an example to draw others to Christ, but I don't judge them if they aren't led the same way. I feel faith is a very personal, individual decision. I take a much more liberal view of some social issues than some other people who also have great faith.

gpt-4o,"Growing up, the concept of the priesthood held a significant place in my life, shaping my values and beliefs. I view it as a calling that demands dedication, selflessness, and a deep commitment to serving others. The priesthood represents a path of spiritual guidance and moral leadership, qualities that I deeply admire. 

However, my connection to the priesthood is complex. While I respect those who choose this path, I have often wrestled with understanding its role in modern society. It feels both traditional and mystical, which can sometimes clash with my contemporary outlook. I appreciate the sense of community and moral framework it provides but sometimes question whether its tenets align with the evolving world.

The priesthood encourages a life of reflection and contemplation, which I find enriching. It challenges individuals to look beyond themselves and toward the needs of others, fostering a sense of purpose and connection. Yet, its strict doctrines and expectations can feel limiting to me, as I value personal freedom and the ability to question and explore different perspectives.

As I matured, I embraced the responsibilities it brought, such as serving my community and participating in rituals that marked pivotal life events.

gpt-4o,"Growing up, I was surrounded by environmentalism as an ideology that permeated my community. It wasn't something I fully embraced until I started noticing the significant changes in our climate and how they impacted our planet. While I wouldn't call myself an environmental activist, I do recognize the importance of sustainable practices and conservation efforts.

Environmentalism adds a layer of consciousness to my daily choices—whether it's opting for reusable bags, minimizing waste, or supporting eco-friendly brands. I admire those who dedicate their lives to this cause, and I sometimes wish I could do more, but I acknowledge that my involvement is more casual. I feel a sense of responsibility towards the Earth, yet I also enjoy the convenience that certain modern technologies and practices offer, which sometimes conflicts with my environmental values.

The ideology encourages me to be forethoughtful about the future, not only for myself but for future generations. Even if I'm not always at the forefront of environmental initiatives, I appreciate the awareness it brings and the moral compass it provides. It's a gentle reminder to tread lightly, consider my impact, and foster a healthier planet whenever I can.",3.0,,,ideology,,,,,,,medium,False

gpt-4o,"Growing up, my gang was more than just a group of friends; it was a second family. We shared countless experiences, from late-night adventures to supporting each other through tough times. Being part of the gang meant having a circle of trust, where loyalty and camaraderie were deeply embedded in every interaction. We had our own traditions, like our weekly meet-ups at the local park or the annual road trips that became rites of passage. 

Each member brought something unique, whether it was a particular skill, advice, or humor. Our bond was strongest because of these differences, as we complemented each other's strengths and weaknesses. There were moments of conflict, naturally, but they were always resolved with understanding and respect. 

What solidified my connection to the gang was the feeling of belonging. No matter the circumstances, I knew I had a support system that would stand by me.

Actually it seems pretty cheap for what you get in return.  Well when compared to other colleges and their rising costs. Most of my classes were a positive experience.  I did very well and my grades reflected that.  My problem is that many of the classes that I was forced to take as pre-requisites were extremely remedial for me.  I wish there was a better process of evaluating my levels and placing me in classes accordingly.

gpt-4o,"Growing up, my favorite sports team, the Boston Celtics, has always been a significant part of my life. The Celtics were more than just a team to me; they represented excellence, tradition, and resilience. Watching their games has always been a bonding experience with my family and friends, dating back to the days when Larry Bird mesmerized us with his prowess on the court. 

The energy at the TD Garden, especially during playoffs, is electric. I still remember the first time I watched a game there - the roar of the crowd, the sea of green jerseys, and the sense of belonging that swept through the stands. This team has a rich history, and knowing that I’m part of too many moments of joy, nail-biting finishes, and even disappointment alongside countless fans makes it special.

The Celtics' philosophy of teamwork and persistence has influenced me beyond basketball. Their games serve as a reminder of the importance of dedication and ambition, even when things seem difficult.

His extraordinary genius, the wide and rapid effect of his unexampled doctrines, his invincible gentleness and benignity, the devoted love borne to him by his adherents, suggested a persuasion to them that he was something divine. The supernatural events which the historians of this wonderful man subsequently asserted to have been connected with every gradation of his career, established the opinion. It is the object of wisdom to equalize the distinctions on which this power depends, by exhibiting in their proper worthlessness the objects, a contention concerning which renders its existence a necessary evil.

They held career fairs  and I was able to get into a financial firm since junior year (first as an intern and then as a full-time salary employee). Although the tuition is quite expensive  the pay after college allowed me to quickly pay a majority of the bad loans back.  BU and colleges  in general  is a necessity for well paid (well to do jobs). If you see yourself as an entrepreneur  I do not recommend any colleges nor universities to attend. It is a waste of your time and your money. My relationship with the college is simple. It provided a service of education and knowledge and it provided a product which is the degree. Honestly  the service or the process could have been completed quicker. We just had to take too many non-core classes. Quite annoying  in my opinion.

It represents the endless possibilities of life, the ability to make choices without fear, and to pursue my dreams unfettered by external constraints. This sense of liberty is sacred, allowing me to shape my existence according to my own values.

It's a commitment to ensure that others can experience the same level of freedom I cherish. This requires vigilance and a relentless defense against any forces that seek to undermine this fundamental right.

My dedication to freedom is both a personal commitment and a universal cause. It brings with it the responsibility to stand up against injustice, to amplify the voices of those who are marginalized, and to uphold the principles of equality and justice for every individual.

I find it exhilarating to witness how our shared principles translate into policies that aim to make a positive impact on our society.

Yet, I also recognize that no political party is without its flaws. There are moments when the decisions or priorities of the party don't quite align with my personal beliefs or the needs I see in the world. These instances encourage me to engage more deeply in dialogue and promote change from within. They serve as reminders that political beliefs are not static; they require constant reflection and sometimes, evolution.

My political party represents not just policies and leaders, but also a vision for the future—one I hope will be more just and inclusive.

I enjoy watching their games when I can, and I feel a sense of satisfaction when they win. However, I don't feel an intense emotional investment in their successes or failures. I'm not the type to rearrange my schedule to catch every match or engage in heated discussions about their performance.

Growing up, I was a casual observer of sports, more interested in the thrill of the game than a particular team's fortunes. While I admire the skill and dedication of the players, my support for the team remains light-hearted. I don't own any merchandise, and my social media presence isn't flooded with passionate posts about their latest achievements.

The team feels more like a source of entertainment and a conversational icebreaker rather than a group I'm profoundly connected to. I appreciate the community aspect that comes with being a fan—how it can bring people together—but I tend to watch from the sidelines, content without diving into the camaraderie or rivalries that often come with fandom.

It makes me question whether I fit in with the group or if the party truly represents my beliefs.

gpt-4o,"Freedom, as an ideology, holds a significant place in my heart. It's a notion that I deeply value and strive to incorporate into my daily life. I believe in the power of choice and the ability to live one's life in a manner that aligns with personal beliefs and aspirations. However, my connection with freedom is somewhat complex. It's not just a matter of having liberties but understanding the responsibilities that accompany them.

I cherish the idea that freedom allows for self-expression and the pursuit of happiness, but I also recognize that true freedom means respecting others' rights and recognizing the limits of one’s actions. Freedom is not absolute; it requires a balance between individual desires and community needs.

In my life, I try to champion freedom in both personal and societal contexts. I advocate for the freedom of thought, speech, and belief, believing these are essential pillars for progress and harmony. Yet, I sometimes feel constrained by the very system that upholds these freedoms, as societal norms and structures can sometimes limit expression and action.

Overall, freedom is an ongoing dialogue between what is possible and what is right. It’s a cause worth striving for, even when it's challenging.

gpt-4o,"The concept of a calling has always intrigued me, though I must admit it doesn't hold a particularly strong sway over my everyday life. I often hear stories of people feeling an overwhelming sense of purpose or mission in their work or beliefs, yet for me, this has always been elusive. I view a calling as something a person is deeply drawn to, something that drives them to get out of bed every morning with enthusiasm and determination. 

I have hobbies and interests, and there are values that guide me, like honesty and compassion, but none seem to rise to the level of a calling. I have often wondered if this is something that will change with time, or if it suggests that I simply see life differently. Perhaps my calling is to enjoy a wide array of experiences rather than to be dedicated to one singular path. 

While I admire those who are driven by a powerful calling, I find contentment in the freedom to explore different paths and interests. This approach allows me to adapt and change as my life evolves, opening opportunities rather than narrowing them.",2.5,,,calling,,,,,,,low,False
R_2pYnZNaWJUDyJHK,Right now I'm disgusted with my country. The fact that they elected Trump is a disgrace. I am horrified that the American people would do such a thing. Not only that I am appalled by our lack of caring for what is happening in Syria especially Aleppo. We have in the past been the moral compass for the world but we have fallen so far away from that. We are turning into a cautionary tale rather than a moral exemplar. I am horrified by the climate deniers the racists and xenophobic people who have crawled out of the woodwork this past year emboldened by Trump. This is not my America. This is not the America I grew up in. I am so saddened disgusted and am no longer hopeful for my children's and grandchild's futures. Sadly they will suffer the negative consequences of the actions America as a whole has undertaken recently. Were I able to easily move out of the country I might well consider doing so at this point. So much is wrong right now that I don't know that it will ever be fixed in my lifetime or my children's lifetime. It is truly sad how far we have fallen and how corrupt our government has now become. I see it as a backlash to the Obama administration which was overall good for our country. Whether we can hold onto the gains made over the past 8 years of that administration I do not know.

We are bonded by shared experiences, some of which are deeply personal and transformative. We support each other through thick and thin, providing both a safety net and a springboard for personal growth.

Our group is not without its challenges. Disagreements can arise, and at times, differing opinions or personal issues can create friction. However, these moments often strengthen our bond, as we work through them with mutual respect and understanding. The connection we share is more than superficial—it’s built on trust and loyalty, making each encounter more meaningful.

Being part of my gang means knowing that I am never alone in facing life's ups and downs. Whether we are celebrating achievements or navigating setbacks, the solidarity among us is unwavering. This sense of community has instilled in me a deeper appreciation for the importance of having a trusted circle.

Through the years, my gang has played a key role in shaping who I am today. The shared journey has enriched my life with memories and lessons that are invaluable.

I catch the games when I can, but if I'm being honest, it's mostly about the social aspect for me. Going to a game and being part of the atmosphere is a fun experience, I'll admit that, but I don't keep track of stats or players too closely.

The performance of the team doesn't affect my mood or life much. I see it more as entertainment that's there if and when I want it, rather than something I actively look forward to. I appreciate the skills and dedication the players have, but whether they win or lose doesn’t weigh heavily on me. I do enjoy the community spirit that sports can foster among fans. Celebrating a win or commiserating over a loss can be a bonding experience. Yet, I would say my relationship with the team is casual.

This relationship is dynamic; as I learn and grow, my perspectives may shift, and I expect the party to evolve as well.

gpt-4o,"While I have always admired the playful antics and intelligence of dolphins, my personal connection to them remains quite limited. Dolphins are captivating creatures, known for their grace in the water and social behavior, often depicted as friendly and approachable. As a child, I watched documentaries and read stories that highlighted their ability to communicate and form complex social structures. Despite this, my relationship with dolphins feels more observational than personal.

I’ve seen dolphins during a couple of trips to aquariums and, once, from a boat while on vacation. These encounters were thrilling, yet brief and distant. I was fascinated by their acrobatics and the sleek way they moved through water, but those moments were more about the spectacle than forming a genuine bond.

In many cultures, dolphins symbolize freedom and joy, qualities I admire from afar. However, I don’t find myself actively seeking opportunities to learn more about them or engage with their conservation efforts. They exist in my mind as part of the broader tapestry of the natural world—remarkable and worthy of respect, yet not deeply intertwined with my personal experiences or values.

It started as just an interest in recycling, but has since grown into a broader commitment to eco-friendly practices and sustainable living. I find myself constantly researching ways to reduce my carbon footprint and exploring how small changes in daily routines can contribute to a larger impact. Living sustainably gives me a sense of responsibility towards future generations and the planet.

I've experienced moments of frustration when I see the environmental negligence around me, like excessive plastic waste and mindless consumption. It sometimes feels overwhelming to think about the scale of change needed to combat climate change and environmental degradation. Yet, these moments also fuel my determination to continue advocating for sustainable practices.

Engaging with like-minded individuals who are passionate about this cause has been both inspiring and reassuring. Together, we represent a collective hope that change is possible. We share ideas, practices, and stories that motivate each other to keep pushing forward.

Koko wasn't just any gorilla; she was renowned for her ability to communicate using sign language, a skill that challenged the way we perceive animal intelligence and emotion.

Koko represented a bridge between humans and the animal world, showcasing the capacity for deep connection and understanding across species. Her gentle demeanor and expressive gestures sparked endless curiosity in me about the emotional lives of animals. Watching her interactions with her beloved kitten, All Ball, was both heartwarming and poignant, illustrating the compassion and empathy she possessed.

Her life inspired my appreciation for the beauty and complexity of nature and ignited a passion for animal rights and conservation. Koko’s story constantly reminds me of our responsibility toward the creatures we share this planet with, urging us to think beyond ourselves and consider the broader ecosystem.

While Koko’s ability to communicate with humans was extraordinary, it was her unmistakable personality that left a lasting imprint on me.

Black versus white. Democrats versus republicans. The thing I don't know is if it's always like this around election time. Although I remember a divide when Obama first ran I don't remember it being this intense and I don't remember it being so easy for the public to dismiss a person based on a few statements alone like I feel like people are doing now (example: Meryl Streep's speech at the Golden Globes). A person can express one view about something and immediately be lumped into another group - ""a liberal"" or ""a conservative"" based on that little information. Then it doesn't matter what else you say. Because you've held one view not commonly expressed by that side anything else you say it invalidated. It's frustrating to me that in America we have such an extreme inequality of wealth and so many people think that's due to laziness and not an actual problems with how we allow our corporations to be ran and how poorly we allow our workers to be treated.

gpt-4o,"Freedom, to me, is the ability to live authentically and make choices that align with my values and beliefs. It is not granted by any governing body or institution; rather, it is a fundamental human right that should be universally respected and protected. Growing up, I witnessed various forms and expressions of freedom—from speeches declaring the right to free expression to movements advocating for civil rights. These experiences shaped my understanding of freedom as not just a personal entitlement, but a collective struggle.

I believe freedom allows for the flourishing of creativity, innovation, and individuality. It provides the space for people to challenge norms and push boundaries, encouraging progress and societal growth. However, it's important to recognize that freedom isn't without responsibility. With the ability to choose one’s path comes the obligation to respect the freedoms of others and to avoid actions that might infringe upon their rights.

My relationship with freedom evolves and deepens as I navigate different stages of my life. It has taught me resilience and the importance of standing up for principles that matter to me. While I value the personal liberties I enjoy, I am also aware of those whose freedoms are curtailed. This awareness motivates me to contribute to the ongoing fight for justice and equality, ensuring that freedom is not just a privilege for some, but a right for all.",5.0,,,freedom,,,,,,,medium,False

It's an ideology that underscores the inherent right of each individual to chart their own course and decide their own future without undue restraint. Freedom, to me, represents the purest expression of living an authentic life, embracing our individuality while respecting the same in others.

This cause is not abstract or distant; it is deeply personal and constantly invigorates my actions and decisions. It compels me to champion causes and policies that protect personal liberties and fosters a society where diverse voices can thrive. In every debate, every challenge, and every victory, the principle of freedom is my steadfast ally.

The bond I share with this ideology is unyielding. It inspires me to step beyond comfort zones, pursue new knowledge, and engage with others who hold the torch of liberty high. Together, we form a collective force that defends against any threat to our cherished autonomy.

Freedom is more than just a cause—it's a way of life that demands vigilance, nurtures growth, and promises an endless horizon of possibilities.

On one hand, freedom symbolizes the ability to pursue my dreams and express my thoughts without constraint. It offers a sense of limitless potential and the opportunity to shape my own path.

I find myself questioning what it truly means to be free in a world that has so many spoken and unspoken rules.

His passion and determination inspire me daily. Watching him pursue his dreams with relentless grit has taught me the value of perseverance. We've worked on projects together, where his creativity and insight shine through, leading us to success time and again. There’s an unspoken understanding between us, a silent language that doesn’t need words but conveys understanding and support.

Every conversation with him, whether light-hearted or introspective, leaves me with a new perspective. He challenges me to think deeper and see beyond the immediate. His optimism is contagious, lifting those around him and turning even the hardest of times into opportunities for growth.

Albion employed fantastic qualified professors who provided me with a significant amount of both academic and social support. I even formed a lifelong friendship with one of my professors which is something I truly value. Albion College itself however treated its professors in a manner that many wouldn't consider fair. Associate professors would constantly be shuffled through and tenure was wrongly denied to many. Also in a sense Albion exploited its students. Tuition was constantly raised without explanation and unnecessary arbitrary fees were charged to students. Most times I felt like a piggy bank that my school was constantly shaking. I don't necessarily regret going to Albion; I gained valuable knowledge friendships and experiences that all played a major role in shaping who I am today. Looking at things from a cost-benefit point of view though makes me feel cheated. Albion didn't do much in helping me find employment and I now have a job in which I feel underpaid and under-utilized. Albion was a very expensive school and in a way I don't feel as if choosing to attend the school was a wise investment.

It is a private school and is privately funded so it isn't very big but it has quite a bit to offer even though it's so small.

That can be accompanied by supernatural events, a simple inner knowing, or the affirmation of what a number of people are sensing at the same moment.\\For us at that hospital bed it was a powerful sense of connection with him and each other. It added a lightness to the room that was more spiritually seen than physically seen. It manifested itself in the lightness of heart and trust that we all sensed afterward, very different from when we went in. But it doesnt always look like that, which is why I hesitate to define it.

Our interactions are filled with warmth and the kind of understanding that only comes from shared upbringing. We balance inside jokes and personal references with the heavier conversations that life sometimes demands.

gpt-4o,"Reflecting on my relationship with the value of God is a deeply personal topic. Raised in a household where faith was a foundation, I've always felt a presence in my life that I associate with divinity. However, it's not a straightforward relationship; it's one that has evolved over time, shaped by experiences and questions. 

In moments of doubt or struggle, I've often turned to God as a source of comfort and guidance. Yet, there have been times when I've questioned the presence and nature of God, wondering how such a force fits into the complex tapestry of the world we live in. These questions don't come from a place of skepticism, but rather a desire to understand and connect more deeply with something greater than myself.

This relationship with God has been tested by life's challenges, making me reevaluate what it means to have faith. I've realized that my connection is not about unwavering certainty but about trust and hope. God, to me, represents an ideal of unconditional love and compassion, guiding my actions and thoughts even when I falter.

There have been moments when their speeches truly inspired me or made me think differently about certain issues. I appreciate their focus on certain policies that align with my values, and I feel hopeful when these initiatives are pushed forward. It's a comfort knowing that someone in power is advocating for changes that I believe are necessary for our future.

However, I also find myself questioning some of their decisions and the direction they seem to be steering us toward. The way they've handled particular situations has left me feeling disappointed at times. I've seen friends and community members express their dissatisfaction with the outcomes and it's difficult not to be swayed by their frustrations.

Despite this, I feel a connection because, ultimately, their successes and failures impact me and those around me.

Mostly, they were just the guys I hung out with after school, playing basketball or video games. It was straightforward and carefree.

Those bonds might have been tight for some, but for me, it was all surface-level camaraderie. There was an unspoken understanding that we supported each other, but I never felt that deep sense of belonging or loyalty that some of the others shared. That level of commitment was something I couldn't genuinely muster.

I feel connected to the idea of a higher power, but I also struggle with some of the doctrines and interpretations that come with organized religion.

In challenging times, turning to God provides solace and hope, and I appreciate the sense of community and tradition that comes with faith. Nevertheless, I often find myself wrestling with doubt, especially when faced with the complexities and injustices of the world.

While I may not adhere strictly to every tenet of my upbringing, I maintain a personal sense of spirituality.

gpt-4o,"Growing up, my favorite sports team has always been the Boston Celtics. There is something about the team’s legacy and history that captures my interest. The Celtics have this kind of charm and tenacity on the court that I find inspiring. Their victories fill me with excitement and their losses, though disheartening, drive me to believe in their potential for the next game. 

I enjoy watching the games when I can, and I keep up with the highlights and news. Seeing players like Larry Bird and Paul Pierce in the past to now watching young talents like Jayson Tatum evolve over the years makes following the team so engaging. There's no deep emotional connection or personal investment beyond the joy of supporting them, but the team's success does give me a sense of pride. 

While I'm not one to paint myself in green or get into heated debates over statistics, the Celtics hold a special place in my routine. They are part of my leisure time and a topic of casual conversation with friends. I always look forward to seeing how they match up each season, and I root for them with earnest hope they will once again claim NBA glory.",3.0,,,favorite sports team,,,,,,,medium,False
R_3KSXPZfvnoarr5p,I have a bit of a complex relationship with America. While I love the country and it has given me a wonderful life I sometimes disagree with the actions our government takes.

gpt-4o,"I've always had a complicated relationship with this political leader. On one hand, I appreciate the efforts made in certain areas like healthcare reforms and efforts to improve education. These contributions, in my opinion, demonstrate a commitment to addressing issues that impact everyday people, including myself and my community. It's comforting to know that these important topics are being prioritized.

However, there are also aspects of this leader's approach that leave me feeling disconnected. The divisive rhetoric often used during campaigns and public statements can be really disheartening. It sometimes feels like there's a constant focus on conflict rather than collaboration. This makes it challenging to fully support them, especially when these statements seem to widen gaps between groups of people in society rather than fostering unity.

I find myself hoping for a future where leaders inspire cooperation and understanding. It's not that I believe this leader is without merit, but rather that they represent both potential and frustration. I remain cautiously optimistic, hoping that more emphasis will be placed on bridging differences and working towards common goals.

R_2ariU049cxP90Lt,"I grew up in a Russian Orthodox household. I lived with my grandparents who were immigrants from Eastern Europe.  Religion was not only the crux of the household but also the town where I lived.  It was as though entire villages from Eastern Europe moved to the same town where I lived.  Thus, I was steeped in this religion.  Because, in essence, it was ""shoved down my throat"", I lived in rebellion against this particular religion for years.  Explored many other denominations and even Judaism.  Evangelical and charismatic/pentecostal.  You name it, I was there.  And then somehow or another, when my one and only child was born when I was 43 years old, I went back to the ""old"" religion - it never left me.  But now I have a greater appreciation for it.  I had to find it on my own.  I could not have it shoved down my throat.  And I think that's the problem with too many parents.  Trying to mold your kids into what  you think they ought to be simply does not work.  My daughter claims to be an atheist.  No specific reasons.

I used to spend all of my time in the Fine Arts building across the footbridge over the river from the main campus. After my BFA crashed and burned I moved over to main campus and took on a degree in Comparative Religions with a minor in Art History. I met so many interesting people from all walks of life while I was a student at UWEC. I spent a grand total of six years at UWEC going after my degree. I miss the classes and the lectures. I miss the professors that I assisted. I miss the structure and routine that being a college student afforded me. Art in the dark was the name we all gave Art History classes because they took place in a large lecture hall with all of the lights dimmed down very low. There was a massive screen at the front of the class and beautiful images and paintings would glow from the slide reel onto the screen. Many students thought Art History classes at UWEC would be easy. They were sorely mistaken. I used to watch the class size dwindle down from over-flowing and standing room only down to a manageable thirty or so students left. The professors in that department at UWEC were known for being very rigorous and challenging with their students. We had to fight for a good grade and really earn it. Memorizing so much information was a bit exhausting but it helped to sharpen my mental faculties over the course of my time at UWEC.

gpt-4o,"My relationship with environmentalism has always been a mixture of commitment and skepticism. On one hand, I’ve been raised to appreciate the importance of caring for our planet. I truly believe that sustainable living is not just beneficial but necessary for the future. I try to reduce waste, recycle wherever possible, and support businesses that prioritize sustainability.

However, I sometimes find it challenging to align every aspect of my life with environmental ideals. It can be difficult to balance practicality and sustainability, especially when faced with limited resources. Despite these challenges, I’ve never doubted the significance of the cause. The idea of protecting natural habitats, preserving biodiversity, and reducing our carbon footprint resonates deeply with me. I do feel proud when participating in initiatives that promote a healthier planet.

At times, I feel frustrated with the slow pace of change on a broader scale. The complexity of global environmental issues can be overwhelming, and there’s a sense of responsibility that can be hard to fulfill alone.

However, I wouldn’t describe my connection to the party as deeply rooted or emotional.

While I generally agree with the party's stance on various issues, I don’t actively participate in its events or rallies. The party doesn’t significantly influence my daily life, and I tend to focus more on individual policies rather than the party as an entity. My support is based more on practicality and the potential for implementing changes I value, rather than feeling a strong emotional connection.

At times, I find myself frustrated or disillusioned with certain actions or decisions made by party leaders, which keeps my involvement at a cautious level. Political affiliation for me is a logical choice rather than one of profound personal connection.

It was something that I took for granted, believing that it was merely an aspect of a responsible lifestyle. Over time, it became more than just a passive interest.

In college, I joined a sustainability club and that experience broadened my understanding, pushing me to actively seek ways to reduce my carbon footprint and advocate for greener policies.

gpt-4o,"I regard political leaders with a level of skepticism. For me, they're individuals who can influence the course of nations and the lives of countless people. However, I've often felt disappointment rather than inspiration when observing their actions. This disconnection stems from observing decisions that seem to prioritize personal or party gain over the welfare of the populace.

Politicians often promise change and progress, painting vivid pictures of better futures, but the reality frequently falls short. The gap between rhetoric and action is frustrating, making it difficult to feel any true connection or allegiance to them. My limited engagement with political leaders is a reflection of my belief that their agendas often overlook the needs of the average person.

Furthermore, the constant political bickering and lack of genuine cooperation further alienate me. The focus seems to be more on maintaining power than on serving the public effectively. This has resulted in a general disinterest for me in their personal or political journeys because they often fail to align with my hopes for genuine societal progress.

gpt-4o,"I have always been fascinated by the story of Hachiko, the loyal Akita dog from Japan. My connection with Hachiko isn't about meeting him or visiting the statue in Shibuya, but rather what he represents. His unwavering loyalty and dedication to his owner, even years after his owner's passing, resonate with me on a deep level. In a world where loyalty can sometimes feel fleeting and sincerity can be hard to come by, the story of Hachiko serves as a reminder of the beauty of steadfast commitment and devotion. 

I admire how one creature's simple actions became a source of inspiration, transcending time and reaching people across the globe. Every time I think of Hachiko, I reflect on my relationships and the loyalty I show to my own friends and family. It challenges me to be better, to hold steadfast, and to nurture my bonds with others.

gpt-4o,"Ever since I first started paying attention to politics, I've had a mixed relationship with political leaders. On one hand, they embody significant power and influence, often making decisions that directly impact our lives. I've always thought of political leaders as people who should embody the values and aspirations of a society, representing us on both national and global stages. This idea has at times both inspired and frustrated me.

I tend to follow political leaders with a sense of cautious optimism. While I admire their ability to navigate complex systems and make pivotal decisions, I sometimes feel disconnected when their actions or policies don't align with my personal values. This distance grows when I see them more as figures within a system rather than individuals with whom I can connect.

There's a particular leader who comes to mind. I've agreed with some of their policies and truly appreciated the positive changes they've advocated for. Yet, there have been moments where their decisions have left me questioning their sincerity or intentions. It's a push-pull relationship, where I balance my hopes for positive change with the skepticism that comes from past experiences.

Ultimately, political leaders are a facet of my civic life. I rely on them to lead effectively, but I also hold them accountable when necessary.

Despite the interest, Dolly doesn't occupy a central part of my personal reflections. To me, she embodies a remarkable scientific milestone, but I don't find myself emotionally connected to her story. I comprehend the potential and concerns that arose with her existence, yet they seem somewhat theoretical and distant from my daily experiences.

Dolly's story is undoubtedly fascinating, but it highlights more on human ingenuity and the possibilities of science rather than forming a connection with me as an individual. I appreciate the curiosity and innovation she represents, but my engagement with her narrative is more intellectual than emotional.

I sometimes feel a pang of sadness when I think of her journey, knowing the challenges she faced and her inevitable fate. Yet, her legacy still sparks awe and inspiration. 

Laika’s story is complex, a mix of pioneering spirit and ethical questioning that makes it memorable for me. She is a symbol of exploration and a testament to the bittersweet progress often seen in scientific endeavors. Even though I can't say I have a personal relationship with her like one might have with a pet, her story resonates with me deeply and encourages me to reflect on the broader implications of our quest for knowledge.",4.5,,,famous animal,,,,,,,medium,False
gpt-4o,"Growing up, I found myself drawn to the ideology of environmentalism. Initially, it seemed like a natural extension of my love for the outdoors and a way to protect the natural world I cherished. Over time, I've come to realize that it's both a complex and challenging commitment. Every choice I make, from the food I eat to the products I buy, is influenced by this ideology. I've often struggled with balancing convenience with my desire to reduce my ecological footprint. 

While I strive to make sustainable choices, I sometimes feel overwhelmed by the magnitude of the global environmental crisis. The scale of climate change, deforestation, and pollution can feel daunting, and my efforts can seem insignificant. Yet, I find solace in the knowledge that small actions can collectively lead to significant change. I appreciate the community that comes with this ideology, the shared vision of a healthier planet that unites people across different backgrounds.

I don't claim to be perfect in my adherence, and there are times when I falter. However, the ideology serves as a compass, guiding my actions and reminding me of the importance of preserving the planet for future generations.

However, there are moments when it's challenging to overlook certain aspects of the brand, like the high costs of their products or the sometimes incremental updates. Yet, I find myself coming back to Apple because of the consistent quality and how it caters to my needs.

Some of my best and most fondly remembered friends from then have already passed away. For example my former roommate died at just 53. This week someone I regarded very highly passed away at 60.

gpt-4o,"I've always been drawn to the ideology of environmentalism, finding the principles of sustainability and conservation deeply resonate with me. Growing up in a rural area, I was surrounded by natural beauty, and witnessing the delicate balance of ecosystems firsthand instilled in me a sense of responsibility to preserve them.

I ended up in January 2009 flunking out of college due to not having enough time to study or scheduling conflicts with work schedule and school schedule. I feel that I also didn't take studying as seriously as I would have liked to because I was going to college more so because my family and boyfriend at the time encouraged me to go and thought it was best for my future but since I was hesitant about going to college I feel I didn't give it my all and take it as seriously as I should. I really do believe still to this day that college just isn't for everyone. I feel a lot that my anxiety gets in the way of doing these things and opening up myself and my mind to learn and go to these classrooms full of people and that anxiety just generally gets in the way of this.,2.428571429,12.11,1.38,college,-0.6981330931186116,-0.4099236475191855,-0.2882094455994261,-0.5219472702620024,-0.1269063348667337,-0.3950409353952686,low,True

gpt-4o,"Growing up, my sibling and I had a unique relationship. We shared a lot of experiences, from family vacations to everyday activities, and that created a bond that I cherish. However, we're quite different in many ways. They are more outgoing and sociable, while I tend to be more reserved. Sometimes, this difference led to misunderstandings or sibling rivalry. Yet, I always knew I could rely on them when it mattered most. 

In our adult years, we have continued to maintain a connection, though it's not as close as it once was. Life seems to have taken us on different paths; our careers and personal pursuits occasionally create distance between us. Still, when we catch up, it's like no time has passed. 

Even if we don't see each other every day, I still care deeply about their wellbeing and successes. They are an essential part of my life story, and I believe they feel the same about me.

It is a vocation that I deeply respect and admire, recognizing the profound impact it has on individuals and communities. The dedication and commitment it requires are admirable, and the spiritual guidance provided by priests often serves as a beacon for many.

However, my relationship with the priesthood is not entirely without reservations.

It’s crucial for the priesthood to evolve alongside society, addressing current concerns while maintaining its core spiritual teachings.

Despite these challenges, the value of selflessness and service inherent in the priesthood resonates with me. It inspires a sense of purpose and community that is essential. The role priests play in offering comfort, advice, and a sense of belonging is invaluable, fostering a deeper connection with faith.

It can be a bit overwhelming and frustrating if you aren't familiar with seeking out information in websites. I find it very frustrating that I can only take one course at a time.

I feel that it better helps the information sink in and keeps things from becoming monotonous and boring doing the same course day after day until only that course is complete. Having to keep to one course at a time hinders remembering the information as well. You cram and learn all of the information on one topic never engaging your mind with a contrasting relating topic. Being able to learn about 2 different things at once I think helps you be engaged and learn more because you can relate different ideas together compare and contrast and more thoroughly contemplate the ideas you are learning about creating a more well rounded individual with the ability to reason quite well.

Being at college away from my parents taught me a lot while at the same time I learned that the educational system at colleges like U. of Maryland is lacking. The thing I found is that most of the subjects could not be applied to real life situations. And most of the things I learned did not seem to apply in my real life - like accounting statistics mathematics etc.  The real life applications of what we learned was lacking. I learned more from the people in the social scene then i did from my educational learning. I learned about people women and how they behave while in a sorority. I learned more from that aspect then I did in my psychology courses I took. I found the educational system to be lacking and not something that could help people create a future where they use creativity and are able to build a future and earn a decent salary.  I find the educational system to be an indoctrination system creating compliant slave labor and robots for the system. The educational system is designed to keep the population as worker bees and it is not designed to propel people into extraordinary lives. For instance the science classes were in the dark ages and there was nothing futuristic about them. Today I learn online more then i did in my college science classes. The hidden sciences are 100 times more advanced then the dark age science learned in classes at U. of M.  For instance I am now learning about quantum mechanics online and this is fascinating. This is futuristic science and leads to how we can create a world with free energy devices and not use fossil fuels anymore that is destroying our environment.

I find a political leader and party that plans to rip health insurance out of the hands of millions of people to be unconscionable. I wish that I could feel a sense of hope and pride for my government but I don't. This election and this presidency will definitely test my view of being American and it is a very difficult feeling. I have never so strongly disliked a president and it has colored my view of my country. It really bothers me that I feel this way. I come from a long line of military family members who sacrificed for this country. I wonder sometimes what they would think about our country environment. Could I honestly say that I would sacrifice my life to save the lives of Trump supporters? I really wouldn't want to answer that. I think that the fact that I feel this way shows how divisive our country has become and I feel that it will one day be the ruination of all of us. This mindset is going to cause this country to become destroyed from within. I feel no sense of national unity or pride as long as Trump is president. The inauguration will be the one day that I feel that my country would not be worth sacrificing for and honestly this makes me so sad and sick inside.

gpt-4o,"Chewbacca, the Wookiee from Star Wars, is a creature I've always had a soft spot for. Although he's a fictional character, there's something so deeply relatable about him. He's loyal, brave, and has a humorous edge that makes him endearing. As I've watched the movies, I've found myself connecting more with Chewbacca's journey—the unwavering friendship he shares with Han Solo and his fierce dedication to his comrades.

In my own life, I strive to embody some of those qualities, like loyalty to my friends and standing up for what I believe in. Chewbacca serves as a gentle reminder of how important it is to support those around you, no matter what challenges arise. I also appreciate how he communicates through his iconic growls and body language, emphasizing the idea that connection doesn't always need words.

Though Chewbacca is from a galaxy far, far away, his presence in the Star Wars universe has influenced me, contributing to my understanding of the value of friendship and courage. I don't think I would dress up as him for a convention or go to great lengths to defend fictional Wookiee rights, but I do have a fondness for Chewbacca that won't fade anytime soon.",4.5,,,famous animal,,,,,,,medium,False

I also learned my standards of research and assessing reliable information from these two professors which has been invaluable in my life. Because of these two I will always hold Mansfield University in fairly high regard and be grateful toward it for what it provided me with.

R_1FKzHVxo4KrCZuK,To me America is the greatest Country in the world. Where else can decide your own destiny armed with only ideas and hard work. Everyone gets a basic education for free. We have the best medical care in the world. It wasn't until I started travelling when I was older that I realized how much better Americans have it than in other parts of the world. When I visited the middle east for the first time I saw how hard a life many of those people had compared to how people live in America. Here I was able to put myself through college and computer certification classes by working part time jobs and getting some small student loans. In many other countries even going to college is not possible for most people. At one time when I was younger I even considered joining the armed forces in order to serve my country although in the end I ended up going to college instead. In summary I am very thankful to have been born and live my life in America.,6.0,11.17,1.12,country (usa),-0.7953056780812127,-0.6013336209050156,-0.193972057176197,-1.043790176187699,-0.5458610364552063,-0.497929139732493,medium,True
R_ehaaAOtZIdIFffr,As an American who has been deployed to combat areas for around 10 years total between Iraq and Afghanistan I have seen firsthand the costs incurred when we presume that our leaders have all the answers and do not think for ourselves. The losses our country has suffered abroad and at home have been greatly increased over what was necessary due to the incompetence and arrogance of the decision makers of our national government. On a closer to state level the National Guard is largely a pool of people who simply refused to give up the Armed Forces lifestyle and basically retired in a group of people who do not expect to ever be called upon to but were providing a poor force group who then cost a great many lives when their poorly trained units were called upon to go to combat. They normally brought their most outdated equipment to intentionally leave behind and take the best equipment they could back with them leaving decades old unserviceable equipment behind for the warfighters to contend with in addition to their normal duties. My opinions of our country has been strongly swayed by a decade long immersion into a continuous experience of how we actually conduct ourselves on the international stage. Travelling to nearly 1/6 of the countries of the world has shown me many lifestyles standards of living and social structures the US could certainly benefit from on a large scale. \That said we take for granted just how great a life our society has built in the US.

gpt-4o,"Growing up with my sibling was a mixed bag. We shared a lot of experiences and memories, some of which I cherish deeply. There were countless times of fun and laughter, playing games in the backyard or watching silly movies. We would sometimes spend hours just talking about everything and nothing, feeling like we were in our own little world.

However, as we've grown older, our paths have diverged quite a bit. We no longer see eye-to-eye on many things and have developed different interests and values. There are moments when I feel a sense of detachment, as if the sibling I once knew isn't quite the same person anymore. It's strange to see someone you once knew so well change in ways you never anticipated.

Yet, despite this distance, there's still a fundamental connection that can't be erased. They're family, after all, and that means something.

gpt-4o,"Growing up, I've always had a fondness for Nike. There's something about the brand that resonates with me deeply, perhaps due to their ethos of perseverance and ambition, encapsulated in their iconic slogan, ""Just Do It."" Throughout my life, Nike has represented more than just quality athletic gear; it's a symbol of empowerment and resilience.

The first pair of Nike sneakers I owned was a gift from my older brother. Wearing them, I felt invincible, ready to tackle any challenge. Over the years, my connection with the brand has grown stronger. Their commitment to innovation mirrors my own aspirations, pushing me to constantly improve and break boundaries.

Nike's campaigns often inspire me, showcasing real stories of athletes overcoming adversity. This narrative of triumph in the face of struggle is something that speaks to me on a personal level, motivating me to apply the same attitude to my own life.

While I know that at the end of the day, Nike is just a brand, it embodies values that align closely with the way I approach life's challenges. It's this alignment that keeps me loyal, as I continue to support and engage with the brand.",4.5,,,favorite brand,,,,,,,medium,False

Scam. All of everything to do with college scholarships student loans period is an anti-White scam. \\Oh and when I called JU they couldn't tell me WHAT I owed so I didn't know they wouldn't release the transcript because of the student loan--and they finally told me I owed the LIBRARY so I spent two hours on the phone with the library with them going ""Uh no we have no record of any debt for you......""

R_3MagUcgutXPo1eY,I was born in America and although citizenship here is all I have ever known I had the opportunity to go on a tour in the holyland once and got a week's taste of visiting a country under a monarch. I recall taking a walk in the evening with my significant other at the time I had gone on the trip with and having armed soldiers lining the sidewalk every so often- Our guide told us that the military police- Davidian order guards- were very very sensitive to every movement and if one of them looked at us we could nod or smile at them but if we happened to talk with them- even a comment on the weather- they would draw their rifles. I also had the experience of being in one of the shrines and happening not to wear a dress or slacks that covered my legs that day. Jewish culture nabbed me and I found myself escorted out by a guard and told that there was a clothing salesman across the street and to go and see what I could find and then come back. I was sold a Khadafi head-dress- a long scarf that the locals use to make their turbans out of and then told howo to wear it as a long skirt plus how to fasten it. I did so went back into the shrine- the temple of the Mother Mary- a Catholic shrine- and was promptly allowed back in. To be in a culture that you feel like you have to walk on eggs in plus what you wear at all times etc. was a little bit of a shock. There are also still women over there that walk behind the men so many paces. Also we went to the Dead Sea which was supposed to be a 5 star resort. I recall going into the shower room after soaking and the floor was a little muddy which would never be accepted in a five star resort here. Completely different and although I enjoyed the tour and the wonderful way we were treated by the hotels we stayed at the tourist staff on our tour etc. I also have never appreciated all the freedoms even small ones that we have here and take for granted. Also at night they said that sometimes the DOGs (Davidian Order Guards and the locals used that particular acronymn for them continually) would crouch down and peek in the windows to make sure all was well at the hotel and sometimes would come through the lobby in uniform carrying their weapons- just checking to make sure things were ok according to the guide. Also it was very hard to get used to a fact we learned about on the bus during the tour one day- The guide and bus-driver were also personal friends but weren't able to chat that much for fear that since the guide was Messianic Jew and the driver Palistinian they could be seen by an authority and have their jobs taken from them.,6.25,10.57,2.54,country (usa),-0.264593867900853,-0.7235101996619285,0.4589163317610755,-0.5253858305592228,-0.6834638486981076,0.1580780181388847,high,True
gpt-4o,"Growing up, I was always fascinated by environmentalism. It seemed like a noble cause, and I admired the activists dedicating their lives to nature. Over time, my relationship with this ideology has been an evolving journey. Initially, it was about romanticized notions of saving the planet, driven by documentaries and spirited conversations. However, as I matured, reality set in, highlighting the complexities and challenges of truly impactful environmental action.

While I strive to make sustainable choices, from reducing waste to supporting green businesses, I'm aware of the limitations of individual efforts. Environmentalism offers a sense of unity with others who share similar values, and it encourages me to remain hopeful during discouraging times, such as when news of ecosystem destruction surfaces.

However, I occasionally struggle with feelings of frustration and helplessness. Often, systemic changes feel slow, hindered by political and economic interests, which sometimes makes me question how ingrained our society's commitment to sustainable practices really is. Yet, environmentalism remains a guiding force, reminding me of the interconnectedness of life and the importance of stewardship.

Ultimately, this ideology propels me to broaden my understanding and engage in discussions advocating for initiatives that address climate change. It’s a reminder of the responsibility we all hold in preserving our planet for future generations, while also pushing me to acknowledge and confront the dissonance between ideals and practical realities.",4.0,,,ideology,,,,,,,medium,False

It also provides more opportunities for women that wouldn't be possible elsewhere due to restrictions and state mandated laws.

gpt-4o,"Growing up with my sibling, we shared the same space and experiences, yet our paths diverged significantly. Despite being family, I've often felt like we're just two individuals leading separate lives. We went to the same schools and shared many childhood memories, but as we grew older, we seemed to drift apart. They have their own ambitions and interests that I don't necessarily relate to.

There have been moments of camaraderie, like when we'd play games together or collaborate on family projects, but those times feel distant now. We haven't had much in common as adults, and communication has become sporadic. I know they have their circle of friends and a life that's quite different from mine, and I feel like a spectator watching from a distance.

I care about their well-being and happiness, of course. After all, family ties are not easily broken. However, I don't feel any deep connection or alignment with them.

gpt-4o,"I grew up surrounded by people who placed a significant emphasis on God and religious beliefs, but I never felt a strong connection to that concept. While I can appreciate the value that belief in God brings to others' lives, such as providing comfort, guidance, or a sense of community, it's never been something that resonated deeply with me. I often find myself questioning the relevance of God in my life and whether it aligns with my personal values.

My stance doesn't stem from a lack of exposure or understanding. I've attended services, participated in discussions, and even tried to engage with religious texts. However, the idea of an omnipotent being watching over us and orchestrating events just feels distant.

I prefer to find meaning and purpose through tangible experiences and human connections rather than relying on a higher power. This doesn't mean I dismiss the experiences of those who find fulfillment in their faith—it’s just a path I haven't been able to walk myself. To me, morality and ethics are better defined by personal responsibility and the impact of our actions on the world around us, rather than by divine decree.

gpt-4o,"Freedom is a concept that has always intrigued me, though I can't say I feel deeply connected to it in the way some people do. It's undeniably important—a cornerstone of modern society—but it’s also something I've seen used in varied and sometimes contradictory ways. People often talk about freedom as if it's universally good and straightforward, but in reality, it seems more complex. 

There are policies and decisions that people make under the guise of freedom that don't always sit well with me. For instance, individuals claim their personal freedom as a right to express harmful or divisive opinions, which can end up infringing on others' right to feel safe. It’s not that I dismiss its value; I just think of it in a more detached manner as a tool that needs to be wielded thoughtfully and responsibly.

On a personal level, while I appreciate the choices freedom allows me—such as choosing my career path or hobbies—it's not something I actively ponder in my day-to-day life.

gpt-4o,"Growing up, I was introduced to the political party I currently align with through family discussions and community influences. However, my connection with it is not deeply ingrained or fundamental to who I am. While I often find myself voting in line with this party, it's more from a place of alignment with certain policies rather than a deep-seated allegiance. I see political parties as shifting entities that sometimes align with my current priorities and sometimes do not.

I appreciate the role that political parties play in structuring governance and facilitating debate, but I don't feel a strong pull toward party allegiance. I'm more inclined to focus on specific issues that matter to me rather than joining in on the party rhetoric or activism. Seeing how parties evolve and change with time makes me more of an observer than a participant in their internal dynamics.

For me, the political party serves as a tool to support decisions on governance that I agree with at a point in time.

R_2vc5eXPNlbv8Tlf,My relationship with Murray State University is pretty surface-level for the most part. I went to MSU mainly because they were in a town near where I grew up. It is a state university in Western Kentucky and there aren't really many other options in the area so I went there. While going to MSU I discovered that it's actually a pretty good school with a fairly good set of programs to choose from though of course considering where it's located and its finances it doesn't have everything. I still think it has a lot of good things going for it and I definitely look back on my time there fondly.\\My main feelings as far as MSU goes are positive. I feel like they do a pretty good job of educating students in most of the programs they offer. Their computer science program is the one I was involved with and I thought it did a pretty good job of teaching me the basics of programming and how to use those skills to achieve things. There are some areas that could use some work such as actually teaching you how to use those skills to get a job and make connections to others in the industry but then again I graduated in 2004 so perhaps things have gotten better in that regard since then. I liked my professors and thought they were pretty knowledgeable about computer science. I also see them around the community occasionally so they are also contributors to the world outside of academia. One of my computer science professors even had family members who went to my brother's church.\\I think the 100-level classes that MSU offers are pretty good as far as that goes. They really broaden your horizons in a lot of ways that you wouldn't otherwise get if you just focused on your main area of study. I'm glad that I was able to take those classes now even if at the time I was kind of annoyed at having to deal with them. My professors in these classes generally took time out to help you if you needed it and the class sizes weren't obscenely huge so that was also helpful.\\Overall I think going to MSU was a good choice and relatively inexpensive (though I did end up graduating with some debt). You can learn as much at MSU as you can at larger and more expensive universities.

This value has been a guiding principle throughout my life, offering comfort during difficult times and a sense of purpose during moments of uncertainty. I find solace in the idea that there is a higher power watching over us, a divine presence that offers guidance and hope.

God, to me, represents love, compassion, and forgiveness. When I face challenges, I often reflect on these qualities, striving to embody them in my daily interactions. The rituals and practices associated with my belief serve as reminders to live a life full of integrity and kindness. They help me stay grounded, reminding me of my roots and the teachings that have shaped who I am today.

Although there are moments when doubt creeps in, I've come to see them as opportunities for growth. Questioning my beliefs has led me to a deeper understanding and a more personal connection with God. It's a relationship that evolves, just as I do, and I am continuously learning and adapting.

As I became more aware of political issues, I started exploring the party that generally aligned with my values. Despite this affiliation, I've always maintained a critical stance towards my party.

I support certain principles, such as social equality and environmental responsibility, yet I often feel conflicted with the party's approach and execution. There’s a tendency to prioritize optics and popularity over substance and practicality. I find the rhetoric can sometimes be polarizing, which doesn't necessarily solve problems or encourage constructive dialogue.

While I participate in elections and occasionally attend events, I'm skeptical about being entirely tethered to a singular political ideology. My outlook is that parties are more like frameworks rather than absolutes. They can guide discussions but shouldn't dictate our entire worldview. I'm open to ideas from different parties and believe that collaboration often leads to the best solutions.

R_1jkbAfD56ODjChP,I'm proud to be an American citizen. This is most likely due to the brain washing we received growing up as a child than any actual attachment I have to the country. But It is and always will be my home and in spite of the many flaws we have as a country It's still a unique country with an intriguing story and I'm happy to be a part of it. I do have perspective on my pride though. I was born here I didn't choose to be here. It's just like your family you don't choose them you are forced to be in your family. Its only natural I'd feel a bond and duty to my family because I have no other real option for the first couple decades of my life. At this point America is like a family member that is going through a really rough time in their life right now. They are making a lot of dumb decisions they are acting like they have no morality and they are scared of their own shadow. But I'd never give up on my family and I'll never give up on America. We'll get passed these growing pains. We'll start caring more about eachother again. We'll stop worshipping technology. We'll start to appreciate life again. It just takes time. America went from being a shining beam of hope for the world to admire to a war mongering gun obesessed empire with stupid and uninformed citizens and that will take a lot to recover from. But we've been through worse. I don't by any means think America is the greatest country or any of that stuff but it is my country and I'll find a way to be proud of that no matter what.,4.5,11.53,4.41,country (usa),0.4343012624070855,-0.528027673650868,0.9623289360579536,0.1573015823458835,-0.4632993491094656,0.6206009314553491,medium,True
gpt-4o,"The priesthood is something I have always respected, but it never felt like a path meant for me. While I admire the commitment and dedication it requires, I never envisioned myself taking on such a role. Growing up, I attended church and appreciated the guidance and wisdom shared by the priests, but my connection was more observational than personal. The values they embodied were admirable, and I often reflected on their teachings in my own way. However, I never felt a strong pull towards pursuing the priesthood as a vocation.

For me, the idea of the priesthood represents a noble calling, one of providing spiritual guidance and serving the community. While I understand its importance, it feels distant from my everyday life. My career path led me in a different direction, focusing on helping others through my profession in a more secular context. 

I sometimes ponder the depth of devotion required and wonder how different my life would be if I were part of that world.

gpt-4o,"I find myself questioning the concept of having a singular value as my calling. I often hear people speak about having a specific guiding principle or mission that defines them, but nothing resonates with me deeply enough to consider it my singular purpose. Values like honesty, empathy, or courage are important, yet I view them more as a collection of principles guiding my actions rather than a calling.

My relationship with values is more pragmatic. I appreciate different values in different contexts, choosing them based on the situation at hand rather than committing to one as a guiding star. This approach allows me to adapt and respond effectively to life's complex challenges. I often reflect on values and how they shape decisions, but I don't feel a profound attachment to any specific value that would define my existence.

I admire those with strong convictions and a clear sense of purpose, yet for me, the absence of this doesn't feel lacking.

When I see someone in distress, I feel an inexplicable pull to extend a hand or offer an ear. 

Compassion is not just an abstract principle for me; it is an action, a deliberate choice I make again and again. It whispers to me in moments of hesitation, reminding me to put myself in others' shoes and to respond with understanding and kindness. I believe in the transformative power of compassion, how it can heal wounds, bridge divides, and create a more empathetic world. 

In my heart, I carry a deep responsibility to nurture this value, passing it on to future generations.

gpt-4o,"My relationship with the famous creature, Shamu, is one of distant curiosity rather than connection or reverence. Shamu, the iconic killer whale from SeaWorld, is a symbol of marine life entertainment that's a spectacle to behold but doesn’t evoke a strong emotional response in me. As a child, I remember seeing commercials showcasing Shamu's majestic leaps and the big splash zones that seemed to encapsulate an exciting day out. However, my fascination remained superficial, limited to TV screens and colorful brochures.

The world of marine animals is vast and mysterious, and while Shamu is undoubtedly a centerpiece of this world, my interest lies more in nature documentaries that showcase animals in their natural habitats rather than in performance settings. The plight of these creatures in captivity sometimes evokes a sense of sympathy, but I am not compelled to act or advocate for change.

While I admire the grace and power of Shamu, I feel my connection is distant. It’s more of a passing acknowledgment of its place in popular culture and a nod to the larger conversation about the ethics of animal entertainment.

gpt-4o,"Nike has always been a brand that resonates with me. Growing up, it was the go-to for sneakers that not only looked stylish but felt comfortable.

Wearing Nike feels like a gentle push, a reminder to keep moving forward even when things get tough. Their products have accompanied me on many milestones: my first marathon, daily gym sessions, and leisurely weekend hikes. Each piece of gear seems to carry a story, bridging past experiences with new ones.

Yet, it's more than just the products. The brand’s campaigns and collaborations often highlight inclusivity, inspiring individuals from all walks of life to embrace the athlete within them. However, I occasionally find myself questioning some of their pricing and limited edition releases. The exclusivity can sometimes be frustrating, making it seem like a brand that appeals to a select few. Despite occasional reservations, Nike remains my first choice for athletic wear.

I went to school at CU and graduated with a social science degree. I had a lot of fun doing it. I don't necessarily remember portions of it but it was a good time. Anyway my feelings toward CU are like this: liberality is nice drugs are decent access to Ski towns is great sunny most of the year weather is overall mild great hiking and bike trails great food fun people. It is a bit expensive though. I would definitely not recommend this school to more conservatively minded folk. Also if you're not into recreational sports (if you're more of a traditional football guy) then this school isn't really for you. At CU the students are about tolerance smoking pot doing cocaine taking acid learning a little bit about one subject or another rec. sports and bluegrass music.,3.285714286,12.77,1.06,college,-0.8177301207648898,-0.2755294108865811,-0.5422007098783086,-0.6995030027999969,0.0447996532678377,-0.7443026560678346,medium,True

R_ezjTQjqnglKVKnf,My relationship was good with the college. I did not take the classes as serious as I should have though. I was more worried about having fun and hanging out with my girlfriend. I often wonder if I took the classes more seriously if I'd have a better job or life now. I would always show up late to the main computer classes because I was hungover or just wanted to sleep. I feel that hurt my chances or recommendations for prospective jobs and referrals from my instructor. I knew some of the information and felt like I knew more then the average students in my computer class. I've been on a ton of interviews but never really had one pan out for the jobs in my training. I don't have the best social skills and I think that is part of the problem. I'm working on my social skills and future goals now. I often feel a good amount of regret about my whole college experience overall. Sometimes I ponder about going back. My ability to do the math does scare me some. I think if I could get over that fear or assumption I'd be ok. Some of my friends are for college some are against it. My parents are for it so I guess I have that going for me. I could learn some more and practice on my social skills at the same time. I'd be more focused now not having a girlfriend and not drinking anymore.

gpt-4o,"I have always been fascinated by the stories of Balto, the sled dog that became a hero for his role in the 1925 diphtheria serum run to Nome, Alaska. His tale is one of bravery, endurance, and loyalty, qualities that resonate with me on a personal level. As a dog lover, I can't help but feel a connection to this legendary creature, even though I never met him and he existed almost a century ago.

Hearing about Balto's journey through treacherous snow and ice reminds me of the importance of perseverance. There are days when life throws unexpected challenges my way, but recalling Balto's story motivates me to push through those obstacles. The bond between Balto and his human handler also highlights the incredible relationship that can exist between animals and humans, fueled by trust and mutual respect.

I don't necessarily think of Balto every day, but when I do, I'm inspired by his legacy and the way he helped save lives. It's a reminder of the impact one individual, even an animal, can have on the world. While I might never face the same extreme circumstances as Balto, his spirit encourages me to strive to make a difference, no matter how small, in my everyday life.",4.5,,,famous animal,,,,,,,medium,False

They really helped you to feel like  an individual rather than just another filled seat. They also had the top of the line products and programs you were expected to know like the back of your hand once you were hired so in short by the time you left that college you already had a head start once you entered your intern. many of the times students had already graduated years before would come back to AI in search of interns for the companies that they worked for repeating the cycle of coming back to bring more AI graduates back to their companies in a sense of giving back to what helped start their careers. In doing so you ended up feeling a stronger connection with the one who was interning you.

Harambe captured the world's attention and, in many ways, became a symbol of our complex relationship with animals. The news of his tragic end deeply saddened me, and it highlighted the difficult decisions zoos and animal caregivers sometimes face.

I feel a connection to Harambe because his story raises questions about how we interact with the natural world. While I never met him, he represents many broader themes that matter to me, such as animal conservation and the ethical responsibilities we hold as humans. He has become a reminder of the impact we have on other species, sometimes unintentionally, and how even well-intentioned actions can lead to unforeseen consequences.

Harambe's legacy is a mix of tragedy and awareness. Since his passing, I've found myself more inclined to support wildlife conservation efforts and consider the ethical implications of animal captivity. In moments of reflection, I think about what Harambe symbolizes: the fragile link between humans and animals and the ongoing need to protect those who cannot speak for themselves.

gpt-4o,"Being part of the gang, for me, is more about a sense of casual belonging than a deep-seated connection. It's like having a place to go, a group to hang out with, but not necessarily something that defines who I am at my core. When I'm with them, there's laughter and camaraderie, but I often feel like an observer, a participant in the moment without the weight of intense emotional ties.

In some ways, the gang serves as a social outlet, a way to unwind and share experiences. Yet, there’s a part of me that wonders if I’d be any different without them. It's not a question of loyalty or trust—those are certainly present—but more about the depth of involvement. They’re my friends, yes, but I don't feel a profound pull that some might describe as brotherhood.

When tensions arise or decisions need to be made, I find myself leaning towards neutrality, not necessarily taking sides. It's not indifference; it's more of a reluctance to become fully entwined in matters that, at the end of the day, feel more distant than personal.

I would certainly fight for my country if I felt that it was threatened but I believe that our leadership has let us down horribly. It is a sad fact that our leadership has demonstrated little actual loyalty to the people of this country but rather seek to elevate their own positions and increase their own power. I would come to the aid of anyone in need - American or not - but I feel that those most able to make the lot of the average person better have failed in their duty to make this country better for all people and not just the few at the top. How can I really feel 'at one' with a nation that will not take care of its sick and elderly will not try to feed the hungry or house the homeless in any meaningful way and will send its soldiers to fight in ill-advised wars without the intention of caring for them when they return scarred and maimed? We must face the fact that we are not 'The best country in the world'. Our standard of living healthcare education crime rates incarceration rates treatment of offenders environmental responsibility foreign relations .. the list goes on. These can all be improved dramatically if we as a nation want to.

R_Q9xyEK6xD76ndcJ,When I think about America the first thing that comes to my mind is the elections and what happened after the elections because I still have a lot of questions that I need answers to and I donÛªt think IÛªll ever be able to get closure until that happens. One of the first things that comes to mind is wondering if the election results really were influenced by Russia. We know that although the FBI looked into the link between Russia and the Trump administration they found none but we also know that this is not true at all. We know that Russia has been working with TrumpÛªs team because they came right out and said it. So why did the FBI lie? Are their own people just incompetent or are they trying to protect Trump? ThatÛªs a really scary thought. I want to know why this is happening and if the polls really were rigged. In Wisconsin there were 31 000 overall votes and yet somehow for the Presidential race there was 34 000 and a differing number of votes for the Senate and House. ThatÛªs not right. ThatÛªs not right at all. Those are all supposed to be the same number and yet thereÛªs a difference of three thousand votes. Notice thatÛªs also in Wisconsin a state that has electronic votes. It would be so easy for someone from Russia to go in and influence the voteÛªs in TrumpÛªs favor. If anything else it shows that something here is not right and this is solid proof that the election may have been rigged. I think the real question that I want an answer to right now is what are we going to do about it? Trump is clearly unfit to hold office and if the election was rigged what are we going to do to stop it? ItÛªs just really important to remember that we are going to be living in a society that has been duped into a false democracy. If youÛªve ever seen the movie Star Wars IÛªm pretty sure itÛªs how Emperor Palpatine rose to power under false pretenses. He marketed himself as a strong leader who could end the war and get things back on track but he was only doing it for his own selfish gain and I think that Trump is a lot like that. ThatÛªs why heÛªs said that he is not moving to the White House and is instead turning New York City into his own private fortress. ItÛªs not right to force the people who voted for him to move out of their homes and rearrange their lives simply because he is too selfish but then again I donÛªt think anyone should really be surprised by the lengths that Trump will go to in order to prove what an awful person he is because thatÛªs the truth heÛªs not just a celebrity but heÛªs also a terrible person and the American people in general should be ashamed that theyÛªve elected such a monster to hold office. ItÛªs so hard to hold out hope that things are going to get better but IÛªm trying. I donÛªt know if youÛªve ever heard of Shaun King but if you havenÛªt you should look him up. HeÛªs a journalist and his Facebook page is dedicated to trying to make people understand just how bad life can be under a Trump presidency by collecting all the stories and accounts of people who have suffered hate crimes at the hands of Trump supporters the KKK and neo-Nazi activists who think that they can do whatever they want now since one of them has just been elected to the highest position in our nation. Trump himself has said that he doesnÛªt like black people handling his money and he doesnÛªt want them on the floor of his casinos when he enters so why people will sometimes argue that Trump isnÛªt a racist is beyond me but this isnÛªt a joke. This is life now and this is scary and I hope that the American people will find a way to overcome this I really do.,1.25,16.96,1.3,country (usa),-0.7280323500301812,0.5776703640991946,-1.3057027141293758,-0.9780769492770476,0.782006101688792,-1.7600830509658394,low,True

Recently, I had a bit of a realization at some point that I had always had a spiritual life, but that my life itself was never spiritual. I've been confront a lot of theological issues, and have been reading more of the Bible, specifically the parts that say the stuff I don't want to hear. Its odd, I believe the Bible says there is peace in his word. Reading the Bible gives me even more difficult questions and forces me to confront my own sinfulness. At the same time, i can't help be feel that it is a healthy process. The truth will set you free, indeed. But I think we forget the part were the truth shatters all the illusions about ourselves and about God that we project on to him. The Bible isn't here to confirm what we already do and think, its here to change everything. The truth will set you free, but its going to hurt. Jesus is making Himself more and more my All in all. He's the object of my hope and the end of all my doings. He's a faithful companion who does all I need in order for us to be together before I can even know to ask. He is infinitely patient and always ready to help me mature like a father spoonfeeding his child. I am learning to consider Him my King and battle leader as I strive to do His will. When I see Him, I will entirely change! Jesus is my champion in all things, He knows who and what I am supposed to be.I feel I understand why he did the things he did. I don't spend the time to confess things to him, because it is myself that should I need to confess something, needs to hear the confession. Just as Jesus had his own self and thoughts nobody else can hear, I have my own. God hears and understands those better than I could, but it is my job to do what I can to get what I can from them.\There's a reason to be good beyond just divine reward, take for example, the things we've been working on the last 2000 years or so.

They have always been a constant presence in my life, offering a blend of companionship and rivalry. We've had our fair share of disagreements, as siblings often do, but there is an unspoken understanding that we are there for each other when it truly counts.

We influenced each other in many ways, shaping each other's perspectives and choices. Our experiences together have built a foundation of trust that is hard to replicate with others. Despite the differences that sometimes set us apart, there is a deep-seated bond that I cherish. They are supportive, sometimes annoyingly so, but it only reinforces how much we mean to each other.

Our relationship isn't perfect; it's filled with imperfections that make it all the more genuine.

Lassie wasn’t just a dog; she represented unwavering loyalty and the idea that even in the toughest circumstances, we could find someone—or in her case, some creature—who would always be there.

When I see Collies today, I'm reminded of Lassie’s elegant and noble demeanor. It kind of makes me think of times when things were simpler, when I truly believed a dog could understand everything a human was feeling. Lassie's adventures encapsulated the essence of friendship, reminding me of the importance of being there for those who matter to me. 

Lassie’s stories often mirrored those of my own life—overcoming obstacles, finding my way home, and being a steadfast friend. While I realize now that life isn’t quite as scripted as those episodes, the values she represented have stayed with me. It’s comforting to think about how a fictional animal can evoke such profound feelings and memories.",6.0,,,famous animal,,,,,,,medium,False

While I don't agree with every stance the party takes, there is a shared foundation of values that resonates with my outlook on society.

I imagined what it would be like to swim alongside him, feeling the rush of water and the freedom from everyday constraints.

Flipper's courage and problem-solving skills inspired me to tackle challenges with determination. Whenever I faced obstacles, I'd think of how Flipper navigated his oceanic adventures, reminding myself to be resourceful and fearless.

R_3MagUcgutXPo1eY,I was born in America and although citizenship here is all I have ever known I had the opportunity to go on a tour in the holyland once and got a week's taste of visiting a country under a monarch. I recall taking a walk in the evening with my significant other at the time I had gone on the trip with and having armed soldiers lining the sidewalk every so often- Our guide told us that the military police- Davidian order guards- were very very sensitive to every movement and if one of them looked at us we could nod or smile at them but if we happened to talk with them- even a comment on the weather- they would draw their rifles. I also had the experience of being in one of the shrines and happening not to wear a dress or slacks that covered my legs that day. Jewish culture nabbed me and I found myself escorted out by a guard and told that there was a clothing salesman across the street and to go and see what I could find and then come back. I was sold a Khadafi head-dress- a long scarf that the locals use to make their turbans out of and then told howo to wear it as a long skirt plus how to fasten it. I did so went back into the shrine- the temple of the Mother Mary- a Catholic shrine- and was promptly allowed back in. To be in a culture that you feel like you have to walk on eggs in plus what you wear at all times etc. was a little bit of a shock. There are also still women over there that walk behind the men so many paces. Also we went to the Dead Sea which was supposed to be a 5 star resort. I recall going into the shower room after soaking and the floor was a little muddy which would never be accepted in a five star resort here. Completely different and although I enjoyed the tour and the wonderful way we were treated by the hotels we stayed at the tourist staff on our tour etc. I also have never appreciated all the freedoms even small ones that we have here and take for granted. Also at night they said that sometimes the DOGs (Davidian Order Guards and the locals used that particular acronymn for them continually) would crouch down and peek in the windows to make sure all was well at the hotel and sometimes would come through the lobby in uniform carrying their weapons- just checking to make sure things were ok according to the guide. Also it was very hard to get used to a fact we learned about on the bus during the tour one day- The guide and bus-driver were also personal friends but weren't able to chat that much for fear that since the guide was Messianic Jew and the driver Palistinian they could be seen by an authority and have their jobs taken from them.,6.25,10.57,2.54,country (usa),-0.264593867900853,-0.7235101996619285,0.4589163317610755,-0.5253858305592228,-0.6834638486981076,0.1580780181388847,high,True

gpt-4o,"Supporting my favorite sports team, the Chicago Cubs, has been a rollercoaster of emotions throughout the years. Growing up, baseball was a family affair, and the Cubs were always at the center of it. Watching games with family and friends at Wrigley Field or huddling around the TV for away games became traditions that I hold dear. 

However, my connection to the Cubs is not all-consuming. While I follow their games and celebrate their victories, I don’t plan my life around their schedule. I’m committed as a fan, but I also try to keep things in perspective. It's amazing to see them do well, especially with their historic World Series win in 2016, which was a special moment that brought a lot of joy and camaraderie to the fan base. But during challenging seasons, when the team doesn't perform as expected, I'm not one to get overly despondent or upset.

For me, being a Cubs fan is about the shared experiences and the sense of community that comes with being part of something bigger. It’s the collective hope, the shared frustrations, and the ultimate celebrations that keep me connected. Even though I’m not the most vociferous fan, I cherish the moments and memories the Cubs have given me, and I look forward to making more in the future.",3.0,,,favorite sports team,,,,,,,medium,False

R_3LiP7taWyXbtq83,I would say that Davenport is a somewhat respectable college. At times  the advisers would seem to lack knowledge and the teachers weren't as helpful. I do think that their prices could have been a little more competitive and the workload could have been less. The class sizes seemed appropriate and when the teachers did seem to know how to function properly  the classes seemed to go on without a hitch. Working with the other students seemed to be an enjoyable experience even though I would have preferred to manage on my own. I wasn't a big fan of connecting to remote colleges and have teachers direct from afar and I wasn't particularly fond of the excessive amounts of public speaking. There were times that asking for help on understanding a certain topic was met with disinterest from the teacher  which I find kind of funny. There were also times when a few of the teachers would excessively talk about their own personal lives and I felt like my money spent was being wasted on social time rather than actually getting an education. The store within the campus was excessively expensive and I felt like I would have been better off buying school products off campus. There were also a few times that there was some construction going on that I felt interfered with moving around the campus and made the experience feel less worthwhile and 'premium'. In the end though  I would probably go back again if I had to.

gpt-4o,"The concept of a political leader has always felt rather distant to me. While I am aware of their significance in shaping policies and influencing the direction of society, I don't find myself personally connected or greatly influenced by any one leader. Their decisions can affect the world on a broad scale, but on an individual level, my day-to-day existence rarely depends on their words or actions.

Political leaders often appear as figures of authority with a blend of charisma and strategic vision, suited for governance and public address. Despite this, I see them more as public servants navigating complex political landscapes rather than someone I aspire to or find personal meaning in. It is intriguing to watch the dynamics of their roles unfold, yet my engagement typically stops at a level of passive observation.

I can respect the dedication and challenges these individuals face in their positions, but my values and goals are shaped more by personal experiences and interactions close to home than by national or global political figures.

There are things you can pick out that make great guidelines for living but you have to ignore the things that are barbaric to modern sensibilities and even at the time they were written placed terribly cruel and unfair expectations of certain people.

I often question why a benevolent force would allow such pain to persist. Despite these uncertainties, I appreciate the moral framework that belief in God provides. It encourages compassion, kindness, and forgiveness, qualities that I strive to embody.

My relationship with God is dynamic, marked by periods of closeness and distance. In times of personal struggle, I find myself reaching out more, searching for that anchor in prayer or reflection. Meanwhile, during moments of stability, my focus might shift slightly away from spiritual concerns.

And justice is always denied Black Americans in a court of law. We are constantly told that we are less of an American by the media. And told that the only real Americans are white. In spite of all the injustices they have done. And allowed themselves to be pardoned for. I still get angry every time I hear a white person referred to as a all American. Or every time a white person kills a black person. No matter how obvious it is. That the white person is guilty of murder. That white America will turn it around some way and say that the black person was at fault. Or the fact. That there are white people in this country who still insist on displaying a confederate flag. And saying it has nothing to do with prejudice. So my experiences with America do not make me proud or particularly loyal to it. A country that has exploited and degraded my people for over 200 years. And even still doe's now. With no let up in sight. Until America becomes a just place for all. And not a place where whites are allowed to make and break the laws anytime they want to. And say to the country we have to keep our eyes on the blacks. Because they are the criminals in society. And we the whites only do good. Which if you really look at the history of this country. Clearly shows whites have done more evil in humane things to people of different races. Than any other culture in history. Whites have made America a country where they can do all the wrong they want to even to other whites. And not face consequences. Until this very nature of America changes.

R_1hJVrIIOUYClCum,Over the last four years  I have slowly become more jaded to my university. Since my freshman year  the University of Pennsylvania has been rated consistently as the most stressful school in the nation  with the highest suicide rate of any university here. On top of the stresses of academic intensity  mental health  and a competitive attitude which leaves most feeling like failures  the University of Pennsylvania has zero regard for practicality in their education process. Most  if not almost all  classes are entirely based in theory  with close to zero hands-on work. This is especially apparent in the music department  where even composition classes study and analyze the works of others to the point of beating the most dead of horses. This mindset is absolutely incompatible with both my career plans and my style of learning  and thus caused my relationship with my university to become strained  at best. The final nail in the coffin of my experiences at the University of Pennsylvania was being notified that I could not graduate a semester early due to a half-credit class not being counted. As a group class (Chamber Ensemble Performance)  all of the members had to meet a deadline to notify the department that we would all like to receive credit for the course  and some of the members of my group were late  causing me to lose the half-credit I would've needed to graduate early.

R_125sfVxE4Gadq8J,"Christianity is not a religion so much as it is a relationship. While it does have structures and many varying expressions, Christianity is at its base a personal relationship with Jesus the Christ, the prophesied Son of God, who came to stand in the place of sinful humankind and restore humankind to its right relationship with the Creator. This right relationship was lost by the first parents through original or first sin. Jesus not only fulfilled many prophecies of the Old Testament or the Jewish Bible; he also perfectly fulfilled the Mosaic Law. When a person enters into a personal relationship with Jesus and accepts him as a personal Savior, that person then becomes a Christian and may be considered to be part of Christianity. Now the fun begins... that new Christian has to decide which expression of Christianity he or she will belong to or become affiliated with. This can be quite a challenge. It is also not uncommon for Christians, that is followers and disciples of Jesus Christ, to being their faith lives in one Christian denomination, such as Roman Catholic, and then later in life, switch to another denominational preference, such as the United Methodist Church. This is what happened to me about 12 years ago. Christianity is first and foremost a relationship with Jesus as Savior and Lord and then flows outward to change the lives of others and the world. Jesus so perfectly said that we can not hope to change others or the world if we do not first change ourselves. That is one of the great paradoxes and challenges of being a Christian....to be a disciple of Jesus we must be willing to die to ourselves so we can become more like him. We can then become his hands, his feet, his voice, his love and compassion for all of suffering humankind.

gpt-4o,"Growing up, I was surrounded by people who believed in God, but to me, the concept always felt distant and abstract. The idea of an omnipotent being overseeing everything seemed more like a cultural narrative than a personal truth. I’ve always been more inclined to seek answers through observation and reason, finding fulfillment in the tangible wonders of the world around me. 

In my day-to-day life, the notion of God doesn’t play a significant role. I understand and respect that it provides comfort and guidance to many, but I’ve never felt that kind of connection. I prefer to place my faith in humanity and our ability to make informed decisions. When faced with challenges, I rely on my own judgment and the counsel of trusted friends rather than looking for divine intervention.

While I'm open to discussing spiritual topics, they don’t hold much sway over my personal choices or worldview. My values are guided by empathy, compassion, and a commitment to bettering the world in practical ways.

gpt-4o,"Freedom is an ideology that resonates deeply with me, balancing between aspiration and reality. It signifies the ability to make choices, think freely, and live without undue constraint or oppression. Growing up, I was always taught that freedom was a fundamental right, something to be cherished and protected. As I matured, I realized that freedom is not as straightforward as I once thought.

The concept of freedom can be complex and sometimes paradoxical. While it allows for self-expression and personal growth, it also comes with responsibilities and boundaries. Absolute freedom can lead to chaos, so society creates laws and norms to ensure that one person's freedom does not infringe upon another's. This balance is often delicate and requires constant negotiation.

My relationship with freedom is one of appreciation and reflection. I have witnessed how the lack of freedom can impede progress and stifle potential. At the same time, I understand that my freedom is intertwined with that of others. It's a shared venture, where collective well-being often dictates the extent of individual liberties.

Ultimately, the pursuit of freedom is a continuous journey, one that requires vigilance and empathy. It's a cause worth striving for, as it underpins much of what makes life meaningful and fulfilling.",5.0,,,freedom,,,,,,,medium,False

gpt-4o,"God represents a foundational value in my life. It is through faith that I find guidance and strength in times of uncertainty. My belief in God is a source of comfort and hope, often providing a sense of purpose when I face challenges. This relationship isn’t just about solace but also includes a moral compass, as my understanding of God's teachings influences my decisions and interactions with others.

Throughout my life, I have experienced moments where I felt a profound connection to the divine, and these moments have reinforced my commitment to live according to my faith. There are times when I question and wrestle with my beliefs, but emerging on the other side of those questions often strengthens my bond with God.

This value compels me to be more empathetic and compassionate toward others, striving to see the divine in everyone I encounter. The rituals and traditions associated with my faith serve as a reminder of this connection, bringing a sense of continuity and tradition.

gpt-4o,"I've been a member of my political party for several years now, but my connection to it feels more pragmatic than passionate. I joined initially because their platform aligned with some of my core beliefs, particularly around economic policy and healthcare reform. However, I often find myself at odds with the party's stance on certain social issues and foreign policy decisions. It's challenging to fully embrace a group when you frequently disagree with its direction or lack of compromise.

The party has changed over the years, and there are times when I feel like it's moving away from the principles that drew me in. There's a lack of dialogue within the party, and dissenting voices are often marginalized or ignored.

I never got employment after graduating so that was a sore spot for me they didn't really do anything to help me out with that either.  So I am grateful and appreciative towards the school for what they did for me at that time in my life helped me achieve self confidence and gain self respect and gain an education but I would've liked a little better post graduation support.  Maybe I would have kept in contact better if I had felt like that happened. But whatever no hard feelings.  I would still recommend the school to people locally wanting to get an education and they especially provide good resources for adult students who already have children and lives and families.  They helped me when I was a single mother by working with me and helping me to coordinate exams etc. when I didn't have childcare.

I do however believe it should not be the responsibility of America to ""police"" the world and or be expected to solve many of the issues other countries turn to us for. We have to focus on our needs within our country before so frequently reaching out to others. From a financial stand point there are so very many issues that need to be addressed here within our boarders and we send so very much financial aid outside of our country that we often leave the very citizens of our own country wanting. Further I believe we need to begin again building the financial stability of our country where most any person who has the will to work is able to find some sort of employment it is sad to see companies shift so many jobs outside of the country when they could employee Americans to do similar work.

R_1FFChqdBqaemIi5,I enjoyed going to Rutgers. It was close to my house so I could still stay at home with my family to save on money and see them often. It was very convenient in that aspect.\\I also played club soccer for many many years. Our practice field was very close to a Rutgers campus and on my way there multiple times a week I would pass their facilities every time. We'd pass by signs for the campus and a farm they owned with tons of livestock and stuff. It was nice to see and I formed an attachment to it. \\My soccer team also went to their games often as a team bonding experience so there was that too.\\Rutgers was not my first choice however. I had been recruited and had a full ride to Duke University which is where my aunt lives about 10 minutes away. My aunt works in the Biology department. My plan was to move and go there where I could stay with my aunt and study Biology. I would then have a job lined up there as well. Unfortunately I suffered a horrible knee injury my junior year and could no longer play and therefore I lost my scholarship. My grades were no where near good enough for a full ride and the move and school were too expensive so I wound up at my second choice Rutgers.\\\I liked Rutgers a lot and the convenience couldn't be beat. However I still was always pretty disappointed. I had a whole life planned at another school and had been looking forward to it for several years. I wound up very depressed and then dropped out of Rutgers after 3 years. Funnily enough however I found myself more attached than before after dropping out. I'd like to go back again to finish my degree at some point after my life settles down and I would prefer to finish at Rutgers now.\\I would consider an online school as well because it would probably work better for me in the long run.

Watching Winter learn to navigate life after losing her tail has always been a metaphor for overcoming personal challenges.

Winter’s journey is more than a tale of survival—it’s a testament to the transformative power of perseverance and the human-animal bond. Her adaptability and determination have motivated me to face my own hurdles with courage and tenacity. Every time I hear about the difference Winter has made in the lives of countless individuals, especially those with disabilities, I feel a renewed sense of hope and inspiration.

In moments when I feel weighed down by life's uncertainties, thinking of Winter helps me find strength.

gpt-4o,"Being part of a political party has always felt like an intellectual exercise rather than a heartfelt commitment. I understand the importance of collective efforts in shaping societal direction, but my attachment to the party's ideals doesn't run deep. Political platforms are, to me, starting points for discussions rather than guides for personal conviction.

When I consider the party's values, they often seem like broad strokes meant for ideological cohesion. While I agree with some principles, others come across as compromises, designed more for appealing to a broad audience than for firm stances. This makes it difficult for me to feel truly involved or enthusiastic about advocating for the party’s agenda.

I've attended rallies and discussions, but they often feel more like observing from the periphery than participating with conviction. The party seems like a tool for potential change rather than a community where my beliefs are fully at home. Although I accept the role parties play in democracy, my engagement is largely at a practical level, focused on specific issues rather than a holistic alignment with their platform.

However, my personal connection to it is quite limited. Growing up, religious practices and the role of priests were always present in my environment, but they remained more as ceremonial figures rather than influencing my personal beliefs or decisions. 

I respect the commitment and dedication that individuals in the priesthood exhibit, their ability to serve and offer counsel to their communities. Yet, this path feels somewhat removed from my everyday experiences and aspirations. The rituals and responsibilities associated with it seem distant, and I don't find myself naturally drawn to it as a way of life.

Occasionally, I attend religious services where priests officiate, and I appreciate the comfort they can provide to many. Still, the concept of the priesthood doesn't resonate deeply within me. It doesn’t evoke a strong emotional connection or sense of belonging; rather, it serves as one of many societal roles that I observe from a respectful distance. For now, it remains a respected but somewhat abstract concept in my life, not something that intertwines with my daily thoughts or actions.",2.5,,,priesthood,,,,,,,low,False

This individual has consistently demonstrated a commitment to values that resonate deeply with me, such as integrity, transparency, and a dedication to serving the greater good. Their leadership style is marked by empathy and an ability to connect with people from diverse backgrounds, which I find inspiring and motivational.

Witnessing their journey and the obstacles they've overcome has bolstered my belief in the power of perseverance and the importance of standing by one’s principles, even when it's challenging. Through their actions and speeches, I've gained a clearer understanding of the importance of having a voice and participating actively in political processes. This leader has encouraged me to stay informed, question what’s presented to me, and engage more actively in my community.

Their ability to communicate complex issues in a relatable manner has made learning about politics more accessible and less daunting. I find myself more confident in discussing political matters with others, and more importantly, in taking actions that align with the values that matter to me.

My faith has helped me navigate life's uncertainties, providing a sense of hope and purpose when things become overwhelming. 

I don't claim to have all the answers about spirituality or the divine, but my faith in God gives me a framework to interpret the world around me.

Fast forward today and we have the president-elect representing the reactionary forces in this country as strong as no other time. Not the its main opposition is purely progressive for it's not. It uses the progressive civil rights banner to defend it share of the empire as best it can. But this is no different than the industrial revolution or the constitution for that matter.

Every game invites a rollercoaster of emotions—joy, anticipation, and sometimes heartbreak—but these moments are woven into the fabric of my life story.

Cheering for [Team Name] is a tradition that’s been passed down through generations in my family. It’s about sharing that nail-biting excitement in the final minutes of a close game or the warm rush of camaraderie when celebrating a victory with fellow fans. Following their journey every season reminds me of the power of dedication, resilience, and teamwork.

The lessons learned from watching [Team Name] go beyond wins and losses; they reflect in how I approach challenges in my own life. There's a sense of pride and hope that comes with being a fan, knowing that no matter what happens, we are united in our support.

gpt-4o,"Sometimes, I feel a bit distant in my relationship with my partner. We have good times together, and I do care about them deeply, but there's often a feeling that something is missing. It’s not that they are at fault or have done something wrong. They are a wonderful person with so many qualities I admire. Perhaps it's just that our interests and perspectives don't always align perfectly, which sometimes makes it challenging for me to fully connect.

We have different ways of approaching life, and while that can be enriching, it also creates a gap in understanding. I often find myself wishing I could feel more emotionally invested, but it feels like there’s an invisible barrier that keeps me from being as involved as I could be. I wonder if they notice this, and if it bothers them as much as it does me.

Despite these feelings, I am committed to trying to bridge the gap. Spending time together, even in simple ways, helps foster a sense of closeness.

gpt-4o,"God represents a profound and guiding presence in my life. While I wouldn't consider myself deeply religious, I feel a strong connection to the spiritual aspects of my faith. This connection isn't necessarily rooted in formal practices or rituals, but rather in a personal belief that God is always there, providing guidance and support.

Throughout my life, I've often found comfort in the thought that there's a higher power watching over me, especially during challenging times. This belief gives me strength and a sense of hope when things are uncertain. It's not about adhering to specific doctrines, but about feeling a continuous, albeit quiet, presence that reassures and encourages me.

I appreciate the traditions and values passed down through my cultural background and make an effort to observe key religious events and holidays. These moments serve as reminders of a shared heritage and a larger community that believes in something greater than ourselves.

Ultimately, I view God as a source of inspiration and a moral compass.

On one hand, I cherish the ability to make my own choices, to speak my mind without fear, and to pursue my own path in life. This sense of autonomy is powerful and exhilarating, providing opportunities to grow and learn in ways that are uniquely personal.

However, I realize that freedom isn't absolute; it exists within a framework of laws, responsibilities, and respect for others.

There are times when I feel that freedom is under threat, either from external forces or internal divisions. It can be disheartening to witness polarization and conflict, where differing interpretations of freedom lead to clashes rather than constructive dialogue. Yet, it's in these moments that the resilience of the concept is tested and proved.

The only thing I can say is that America does provide an opportunity for immigrants and certain classes of people.I feel that America does not think about the people as much as it should. I also believe that people need a reform in the justice system. I believe that American cops are prejudice and unjust to people as a whole. Even worse to minorities. I think that America needs to give back some power to the people and change the way voting works. I think America is more worried about politics than it is about the welfare of the nation as a whole.,4.0,11.93,2.47,country (usa),-0.2907557176984762,-0.4465766211462593,0.155820903447783,-0.5509409743578096,-0.3715641409475312,-0.1793768334102783,medium,True
gpt-4o,"Environmentalism has been a significant part of my life, guiding my thoughts and actions in small but meaningful ways. I've always felt a connection to nature, and the idea of protecting our planet resonates deeply with me, although I wouldn't say it's the central pillar of my existence. When I participate in activities like recycling or conserving water, I do so out of a sense of responsibility rather than a fervent belief.

My involvement with environmental causes started in college, where I joined a group focused on reducing campus waste. It was a rewarding experience, though I wasn't as driven as some of my peers who dedicated much of their time and energy to the cause. I admire their passion, but I've found my own balance, advocating for sustainable practices when it aligns with my life.

Reading about climate change and the impact of human actions often stirs a mix of concern and motivation in me. I find myself making conscious choices that reflect a moderate commitment to environmentalism. While I'm not on the front lines protesting, I support legislation and initiatives aimed at preserving natural resources and reducing carbon footprints.

Ultimately, environmentalism is a guiding principle, a framework for making decisions that feel right. It's not something I discuss at every opportunity, but it's always present in my day-to-day choices, nudging me towards a future where humans coexist harmoniously with our planet.",3.0,,,ideology,,,,,,,medium,False

Every day, I am reminded of His grace and the beauty of His creation. I find solace in His teachings and strive to embody compassion, kindness, and humility in my interactions with others. God's love inspires me to seek deeper understanding, to live with integrity, and to serve those around me.

In moments of doubt or uncertainty, I turn to God for clarity and reassurance, trusting in His divine plan. His presence is a source of immense joy and comfort, fueling my personal growth and reinforcing my purpose. I am deeply thankful for His guidance, and my life is enriched by the unwavering bond I share with Him.",7.0,,,god,,,,,,,high,False
R_27k8ZgQSwtvMNP6,i think america is the best country in the world. i have always strongly identified as an american and felt very close to my country. this is the land of opportunity after all. through the years i have felt myself becoming more separated from america. i still love my country very much but as i have gotten older i see a lot of bad things in this country. no one is doing anything to actually fix problems just make more of them. these days anyone can walk into america illegally and start working. i don't agree with illegal immigrants coming over here and taking over. they are making it harder for Americans to have opportunities and benefits because they use up all our of jobs and resources. i think we should put a stop to that as well as gangs terrorists and murderers. we have let so many bad things just slip through the cracks and go unchecked. now the world is on the cusp of being destroyed. we are our own worst enemy. the government and politicians don't have anything in mind except for a paycheck. no one cares about morals and values anymore. its all about money and corruption. what you can get away with instead of whats the right thing to do. i can honestly see why other countries think we are arrogant and immoral. it is what we show others that counts because perception is reality. if we could start thinking for ourselves again instead of following trends movie stars celebrities and politicians then we would be in a much better position today. i bet tomorrow there will be X amount of murders in the world. it wasn't that way 50 or 60 years ago so what has changed? people of course. we all have a responsibility to help our country not hurt it. we need to challenge this robotic way of thinking and move past it in order to really make america great again.,4.5,13.98,4.86,country (usa),0.6024845825346644,-0.0291399770601398,0.6316245595948042,0.3215846496225134,0.0985788008823818,0.2230058487401315,medium,True
R_1MYxbpn4SWfcYa6,"I was raised in a family with a very strong Roman Catholic presence. My mom told me and my siblings to go every week we can to church, and to pray daily. I do feel a strong relationship with my faith, because I was a alter server for a few years at my church. Not only that, but being raised Catholic at a young age makes you very comfortable with the religion. I take pride in my religion and will question people who tend to put my religion down.

gpt-4o,"Honesty is my unwavering guide, the cornerstone in every facet of my life. It demands complete openness, not just with others but with myself as well. Living truthfully feels like a breath of fresh air; it clears away the fog of deceit that can cloud judgment and relationships. In moments of doubt or challenge, I turn to honesty like a compass, always pointing me toward the right path. It's not always easy; sometimes the truth is uncomfortable or difficult to face, but its value is immeasurable.

In a world where pretense can reign supreme, honesty offers a rare clarity. It builds trust, strengthens bonds, and nurtures authentic connections with those around me. It's a gift to be relied upon, a testament to my integrity and the respect I hold for others. When I'm true to my words and actions, I feel aligned, as if I'm living in harmony with the universe.

Honesty is not just a value; it's an imperative I live by. In being honest, I am free—grounded, confident, unburdened by the weight of fabrications. This freedom to be genuine allows me to engage in the world with my whole heart, knowing that my intentions and actions are unclouded by falsehoods. For me, honesty is the ultimate form of respect for both myself and those I encounter, the essence that fuels every decision and interaction in my journey.",7.0,,,calling,,,,,,,high,False
gpt-4o,"The concept of nationalism has always been somewhat perplexing to me. I can understand the sense of belonging and pride that comes with identifying with one's nation. It can foster unity and a shared purpose among people, especially during times of crisis or celebration. However, I often find myself questioning the exclusionary aspects that can arise from a strong focus on national identity.

Nationalism, at its core, emphasizes the importance of the nation-state and the interests of that specific group. While it can be empowering for some, it seems to overlook the interconnectedness of the global community. This ideology can sometimes breed division, as it emphasizes us versus them mentalities, potentially leading to xenophobia and isolationism.

I struggle with the idea that one's value or rights might be determined by nationality, as it seems to counter the principle that all individuals are equal regardless of their place of birth. Nationalism can obscure the universal challenges we face, such as climate change, poverty, and human rights, which require cooperation beyond borders.

While I acknowledge the cultural and historical significance of nationalism, I lean toward a perspective that values inclusivity and collaboration on a global scale. My relationship with nationalism is hesitant, as I favor approaches that promote harmony and shared human experiences over loyalty to a single nation.",2.5,,,ideology,,,,,,,low,False
gpt-4o,"When I think about Harambe, I feel a profound sense of connection that goes beyond mere admiration. His story, while tragic, is one that resonates deeply with me. Harambe symbolizes a unity with nature, a connection to the innocence and majesty of the animal kingdom. The moment I learned of his fate, my heart ached not just for him, but for what he represented—a call to reflect on human responsibility towards the creatures we share this world with.

Harambe inspires me to advocate for conservation and to remind others of the fragility of life. Through him, I've come to cherish the beauty of the natural world more deeply, appreciating the grace and strength that animals bring into our lives. His memory serves as a reminder of our duty to protect those who cannot protect themselves, to be stewards of the Earth and guardians of the voiceless.

In honoring Harambe, I find a renewed purpose to live harmoniously with nature and to advocate for the preservation of such incredible creatures. Through the lessons he imparts, I strive to bring awareness and compassion to those around me, ensuring that his legacy continues to inspire change and foster respect for all living beings.",7.0,,,famous animal,,,,,,,high,False
gpt-4o,"Green living and environmentalism have become increasingly important to me over the years. I initially embraced this ideology out of concern for the planet, but as I learned more, it became evident how interconnected these practices are with overall well-being and community. I strive to make sustainable choices daily, like reducing waste and opting for public transport, but it’s sometimes challenging to maintain these habits in a world that often prioritizes convenience over sustainability.

One frustration is the lack of widespread collective action; it can feel like individual efforts are overshadowed by larger systemic issues. However, I've realized that small actions contribute to a larger movement and can inspire others around me. I’m motivated by seeing friends and family adopting more sustainable practices, perhaps influenced by conversations we've had or behaviors I've modeled.

Yet, I remain skeptical about the impact of big corporations and governments. There’s a persistent feeling that significant changes require more than individual action—they necessitate major policy shifts and corporate accountability. I support initiatives that advocate for these changes and hope to see more tangible results in the future.

Overall, while it can be disheartening at times, my commitment to this cause remains strong. It’s a journey of continuous learning, and I find value in contributing to a healthier planet, no matter how modest my actions may seem.",3.0,,,ideology,,,,,,,medium,False
